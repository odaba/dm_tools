The wielder may use the tools to create items using the Craft skill much more surely and quickly. The wielder may take raw materials with a value equal to half the price of an object to be crafted, and produce a finished object in as little as 1 hour for an item with a final cost of 2,000 gp or less. For objects with a final cost of more than 2,000 gp, the wielder can perform 2,000 gp worth of work in a single hour, but only once each day.

A halfling who puffs on the pipe as a full-round action can shape the smoke into an object weighing no more than 5 pounds and having a maximum volume of 1 cubic foot. The halfling can, on following rounds, spend additional full-round actions to increase the object's weight by 2 additional pounds and its volume by another cubic foot. The halfling must succeed at an appropriate Craft check to make a complex item. If the halfling stops puffing on her pipe for any reason before she finishes creating the object, the figure in the smoke collapses and her pipe is extinguished. Objects created by solidsmoke pipeweed last for 24 hours before fading away into vapor. Objects created by the pipeweed have the same hardness, hit points, and other qualities as manufactured objects of their type, but look smoky and indistinct. Each pinch of solidsmoke pipeweed is sufficient for 3 full rounds of smoking. A single larger item must be created with a single pinch of solidsmoke pipeweed, so any item created with this pipeweed can't be larger than 9 pounds and 3 cubic feet. A halfling cannot create an object designed to exactly duplicate or replace another specific object. For instance, while she could create a smoky lock with its own key, she could not puff smoke into an existing keyhole and then create a key that would open that particular lock. This smoke is caustic and chokes non-halflings.

"Chelish Crux ","moderate conjuration (masked by magic aura)",9,"none","2,000 gp","5 lbs.","A Chelish crux is similar to a bag of holding in that its interior space is larger than its exterior would suggest. When closed, a Chelish crux is a wooden and metal dodecahedron (similar in shape to a d12) that measures about 6 inches in diameter. Each face of the crux is carved with a different rune or image-in order to open the puzzle box, a person must trace the outlines of these runes and images with the tip of a finger in the proper order. Each time a rune is triggered in the correct order in this manner, it glows with a soft red light, but whenever a rune is triggered out of order, the light flashes into fire and inflicts 2 points of fire damage per currently lit rune on the person attempting to open the crux (Reflex DC 15 halves) and causes all lit faces to deactivate (forcing the process of opening it to start anew). Failure to open a crux eight times in a row causes the combination of runes to randomize to a new combination. You can simulate this puzzle for the PCs by determining the order in which the runes must be activated and then having the players stumble through the combinations, or you can allow a character a DC 35 Disable Device check or a DC 25 Intelligence check to try to open the puzzle box-each attempt takes 1 minute, and the check can be retried with a cumulative +1 bonus on the roll, to a maximum bonus of +7, after which the crux resets its order (at which point the bonus reverts to +0 and the character must start anew). Failure on either of these checks causes the crux to flash with fire and causes 2 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 15 halves), plus 2 points for each failure. A Chelish crux can be forced open with damage or a DC 28 Strength check. The crux has hardness 10 and 30 hit points. If a crux is forced open in either of these two ways, it explodes into a 10-foot-radius burst of fire, inflicting 3d6+6 points of fire damage to all within the area (Reflex DC 15 halves). The fire damage affects any objects held within the crux as well. If forced open, the crux crumbles to ashes and any objects it contains appear on the ground at the site of the fiery burst. Once a particular crux's combination is known, a character can open it automatically (this takes 3 consecutive full-round actions). Opened properly, the crux unfolds into a 2-foot-square flat sheet of metal and wood. Any objects the crux contains sit upon the center of the sheet. An unfolded crux automatically folds as soon as a character attempts to bend any of the sheet's four corners as a move-equivalent action. The crux automatically folds up around any objects that sit upon its face at this time-objects that would exceed the crux's capacity are pushed gently aside by the refolding action. A Chelish crux can hold up to 200 pounds of objects, but the physical size of each object is irrelevant-the sight of a crux folding up around a long polearm, for example, might make one assume the weapon was crushed and destroyed, but when the crux is next opened, the pole arm is unharmed. As an object that creates an extradimensional space, a Chelish crux functions as a bag of holding for determining how long a living creature within can survive, or for what happens when the crux is placed in another extradimensional object like a portable hole (see Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook, page 500)","Craft Wondrous Item, secret chest","1,000 gp.","Wondrous Item","AP 27",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"NULL","NULL",0,0,,,"NULL",323

The wearer may generate an attack similar to the spell shout, though the sound is mental, and thus does not affect items or creatures immune to mind-affecting effects, and its damage is not affected by sonic vulnerability, resistance, or immunity. In addition, as part of the attack, the wearer may make a DC 20 Charisma check to shape a specific noise or message of five words or fewer. These sounds are purely mental and not heard by any creature outside the area of effect. The wearer may use this effect 1d3 times per day.

If a character who has had this vision comes near death at any point afterward, at the moment he is about to die he may reroll any failed saving throw made within the last round or force an opponent to reroll a killing attack. The character must accept the result of the second roll, regardless of its outcome. Once a character has had the opportunity to avert death, regardless of its success or failure, the journal provides no more benefit and never aids the character again.

This bane effect remains the same for a wielder, regardless of how many times he's used the bow. Thus, for one user it might be a +2 bane vs. humanoids (humans) longbow, while for another it might be a +2 bane vs. dragons longbow. A wielder can do nothing to change the bow's bane effect. In addition, once per week, felhart's wielder can summon a reliable steed as per the spell mount.

In order to function, a grave candle must be placed amid the physical remains of the body to be spoken to. These remains can be partial, or even just a handful of ash or grave dust, but a totally destroyed body (as results from destruction or disintegrate) doesn't leave enough material for a grave candle to function. When it's lit, the smoke rising from the candle grows thick, and a ghostly shape similar to the creature's appearance in life manifests in the smoke. At this point, the manifested spirit (which is as much an echo of the creature as it is the actual departed soul) can speak-a grave candle does not impart any additional understanding of languages. In other respects, the conversation with the dead spirit adheres to the rules for speak with dead (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 346), save that the dead spirit receives a -4 penalty on its saving throw to resist the spell. Furthermore, a dead body can only be successfully subjected to a grave candle once-the burning of the candle ""burns out"" the latent necromantic and spiritual energy left behind by the soul's parting from the world (this does not harm the actual soul of the dead spirit).","Craft Wondrous Item, speak with dead","2,750 gp","Wondrous Item","AP 27",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"NULL","NULL",0,0,,,"NULL",324

"Osirian Spirit Jars","moderate necromancy",7,"none","26,250 gp","2 lbs. a piece","Typically found in sets of three, these clay jars are decorated with the heads of animals and monsters. Though they once likely contained the preserved viscera of ancient Osirian scholars, nobles, and priests, the jars now hold little more than dust. Their true value lies in the benefits they provide spellcasters seeking to transpose their souls via the spell magic jar. Osirian spirit jars serve as focus items for the spell magic jar, forgoing the spell's need for another focus. All three jars function in this way, allowing a caster to move his soul or that of a nearby target into any one of the three jars, or his own soul between jars and bodies as he pleases. The jars do not allow him to shuffle souls other than his own into different bodies, though he can shift souls between jars. Souls within Osirian spirit jars are permanently affected by magic jar, and can potentially be kept trapped within forever. A caster can only move his soul between bodies while his casting of magic jar is in effect. If his spell expires while he is within an Osirian spirit jar, his soul and those in the other jars are trapped. A soul within an Osirian spirit jar can be freed by opening the jar, allowing the spirit within to try to swap souls with that of the jar's holder as per the spell magic jar (a DC 17 Will save to resist), or return to its body if it is within range. Alternatively, casting magic jar on an Osirian spirit jar containing a spirit, rather than an individual creature, allows that spirit to swap bodies as if it were the target of the spell. Should a spirit within an Osirian spirit jar no longer have a body or be outside its jar when its magic jar spell ends, it returns to one of the empty Osirian spirit jars if one is in range, or dies if one is not.","Craft Wondrous Item, gentle repose, magic jar","13,125 gp","Wondrous Item","AP 27",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"NULL","NULL",0,0,,,"NULL",335

Truecolor dye produces vibrant colors, yet the actual color that registers varies according to the personality and temperment of the viewer-the viewer's good, neutral, or evil alignment component determines the color he sees. Good viewers see a pleasing gold, while evil viewers see a rich blood red. A neutral viewer sees the dye as its actual color, a dull orange. Centuries ago, truecolor dye was used in the miracle courts of Tian Xia as a way to trick emissaries into revealing their alignments, but its secret has long since been disseminated on the eastern continent and lost its hidden value.

An oculus of Abaddon appears as a sphere of clear crystal that contains a pinpoint of flickering red light at its center. When held, the oculus feels warm to the touch and fills the holder with a sudden desire to pluck out an eye and place the oculus within the socket-this causes 1d8 points of damage, 1 point of bleed damage, and 2 points of Constitution damage. Once placed in an eye socket, the oculus can only be removed by ripping it free (causing the same amount of damage as the initial plucking).

Any good-aligned creature that carries the skull of Ydersius, even via an extradimensional space such as a portable hole, gains three negative levels. These negative levels remain as long as the skull is carried and disappear when the skull is released. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the skull is carried. A creature that suffers from these negative levels has a 50% spell failure chance on all divine spellcasting attempts.",,,"Artifact","AP 42",,,,,,,,,,"Destroying the skull of Ydersius is a near-impossible task tantamount to killing a god, though methods exist by which such a feat might be achieved. For example, should the skull be reunited with Ydersius's body, the god returns to life, though in a weakened state. This manifestation, though powerful, can be combated and even slain, though it regenerates from nearly any wound short of re-decapitation. For an instant, before the whole body begins to regenerate, Ydersius's spirt is untethered from his form. If Ydersius is dragged bodily before the throne of the goddess Pharasma in the Boneyard and slain in her presence, the death deity can judge the serpent god's momentarily freed essence in that instance, causing his body and skull to disintegrate into dust.

"Totem of Angazhan","strong necromancy and transmutation",20,"none",,"150 lbs.","A totem of Angazhan is a dangerous and sinister artifact created by the demon lord Angazhan-originally, only one such totem existed, but as the reach of the Gorilla King expanded, additional totems began to appear in various hidden parts of the Mwangi Expanse, especially to the south of the Screaming Jungle in the deep, unexplored center of Garund. Each totem of Angazhan possesses a crude intelligence and can observe the world around it via true seeing. It can also hear and possesses tremorsense. All three of these senses extend to a range of 30 feet; the totem cannot detect anything beyond this range. A totem of Angazhan constantly radiates an aura of fear that fills the minds of any creatures within 30 feet with cruel memories of past lives in which they were consumed alive by apes-whether or not these past deaths are accurate is irrelevant to the sensation of horror they invoke in victims. All non-worshipers of Angazhan within this area must make a DC 15 Will save each round to avoid becoming panicked for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. Once per round, a totem of Angazhan can cast weird. This is its primary means of defense, and it can target all creatures within 30 feet that it can sense. The effect manifests at caster level 20th, and has a save DC of 23. Once per day, a totem of Angazhan can reincarnate a single creature that dies within 30 feet of it. Unlike the spell of the same name, the reincarnated creature always returns to life as a Chaotic Evil charau-ka. A creature reincarnated as a charau-ka gains +4 Str, +2 Dex, and +4 Con. Once per year, the totem may instead use its reincarnate ability to bring a creature back to life as a Chaotic Evil dire ape-it is this ability that creates the creatures that go on to become Gorilla Kings. A creature reincarnated as a dire ape gains +8 Str, +4 Dex, and +6 Con. When a new dire ape champion is created, it becomes infused with a desire to seek out the current Gorilla King and challenge him to a fight to the death-the survivor continues ruling as the Gorilla King for another year. In this fashion, the Mwangi Expanse has never gone for more than several months without a Gorilla King for the past several hundred years. As with all reincarnate effects, the creature being restored to life must be willing for the effect to work-the creature to be reincarnated knows that accepting the offer to come back to life enslaves its soul to Angazhan (resulting in the shift to Chaotic Evil and the drive to seek out and replace the current Gorilla King). If a totem of Angazhan is placed upon or adjacent to an altar of Angazhan that is under the effect of an unhallow spell cast by a worshiper of Angazhan, the totem of Angazhan's sensory range extends to 300 feet, and it can use its abilities in this extended range as long as it has line of sight to its target.",,,"Artifact","AP 42",,,,,,,,,,"A totem of Angazhan can be destroyed only by a Gorilla King (either acting on his own volition or while under the effects of magical control), who can damage the totem as if it were a normal item with hardness 8 and 100 hp (or with a DC 30 Strength check to break the totem in half ). Of course, once a Gorilla King makes his first attack upon one of these totems, the blasphemy against Angazhan causes that Gorilla King to no longer count as a worshiper of Angazhan, and he can now be affected by the totem's fear aura. Worse, the affront allows the totem of Angazhan to attempt once per round to revoke that Gorilla King's reincarnated body. Each round the blasphemous Gorilla King remains within reach of the totem's senses, the Gorilla King must make a DC 25 Fortitude save to avoid being transformed back into whatever race the creature was before he was reincarnated. Once this occurs, the target is no longer a Gorilla King and can no longer damage the totem, but the totem continues to use weird to attempt to slay the creature as long as it is able.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,"strong",150,0,0,,,"NULL",902

Within the vial roils a small wisp of white vapor, churning as if caught in a miniature vortex of air. To capture a haunt's energies within a haunt siphon, you need only twist the metal casing to open the vial in the same round that the haunt manifests (a standard action)-this can be before or after the haunt has acted. You must be within the haunt's area of influence to use a haunt siphon. When you activate a haunt siphon, it deals 3d6 points of positive energy damage to a single haunt. If it deals enough damage to the haunt to reduce the haunt's hit points to 0, the mist inside the haunt siphon glows green-if it does not reduce the haunt to 0 hit points, the haunt siphon is still expended and becomes nonmagical. It may take multiple haunt siphons to destroy powerful haunts. A haunt that is neutralized by a haunt siphon takes a -5 penalty on its caster level check to manifest again after its reset time passes. A haunt siphon that neutralizes a haunt can no longer be used to harm haunts, but it can be used as a grenadelike splash weapon that deals 1d6 points of negative energy damage with a direct hit.

Three types of spirit planchettes exist-brass, cold iron, and silver. Each in turn allows an increasingly potent form of divination effect to be utilized. A spirit planchette requires a board to move upon, but this ""board"" can be made up of letters scribed upon any smooth surface-it need not be a prepared board for a spirit planchette to work.

Dials on the cylinder's side control whether the brain can see, hear, or speak using a raspy speaker built into the cylinder's surface. The brain can speak and understand any languages it knew in life, and retains the use of the following skills at the values it possessed while alive: Appraise, Bluff, Diplomacy, all Knowledge skills, Linguistics, Perception, and Sense Motive. It retains no other abilities it possessed in life, including purely mental abilities.

The Amatatsu Seal has a daily allotment of 5 charges that it can use to cast the following spells on an Amatatsu scion: cure serious wounds, remove curse, remove disease, or restoration. Each casting uses up 1 daily charge. Alternatively, the seal can cast heal on an Amatatsu scion, but doing so expends all 5 charges. Finally, and only at the seal's discretion, it can cast resurrection on an Amatatsu scion, but doing so renders its spellcasting powers useless for a month. The Amatatsu Seal itself radiates strong magic, and those with the proper resources can sense this magic across oceans and continents, allowing it to be tracked across any distance. Originally meant to allow its rightful owners the ability to track it if stolen, this feature makes it dangerous to remove the seal from its warding box, for as long as the warding box is open, the oni of the Five Storms can track it. The repercussions of this are detailed in later adventures in the Jade Regent Adventure Path. One final ward exists on the Amatatsu Seal, confounding attempts to whisk it quickly away from its homeland but also making returning a stolen seal home an arduous task. The Amatatsu Seal can never be transported by teleportation magic or dimensional travel. It cannot be taken from the Material Plane save via special portals blessed by the gods, and characters who carry the seal cannot cast or otherwise use teleportation effects.",,,"Artifact","AP 49",,,,,,,,,,"To destroy the Amatatsu Seal, rightful scions of each of the five royal families of Minkai must, of their own free will, cast their families' seals together into the Well of Demons in the Imperial Shrine in Kasai Harbor.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"strong",0,0,0,,,"NULL",953

"Shinobi Fuhonsen","strong illusion",15,"neck",,0,"The shinobi fuhonsen is said to have been the first payment ever made to a ninja in the history of Minkai. The tarnished bronze coin has a square central hole and bears six ideograms on its two faces-four on one face and two on the other, with two spaces apparently left blank. A leather thong is threaded through the coin's central hole, allowing the coin to be worn around the neck. The six ideograms on the coin correspond to six different skills: Acrobatics, Climb, Disguise, Escape Artist, Perception, and Stealth. A DC 30 Knowledge (arcana) or DC 20 Linguistics check identifies the ideograms and their corresponding skills. The shinobi fuhonsen currently has six powers, each corresponding to one of the six ideograms and its associated skill. If a new owner has at least 8 ranks in another skill, the shinobi fuhonsen gains an additional power based on that skill, and a new ideogram emerges on the coin's surface. The new power and the skill it corresponds to are left up to the GM, though the power should be related to its skill, and the skill should be one on which the owner often relies. Although the existing powers of the shinobi fuhonsen are based on skills common to rogues and bards, new powers and their corresponding skills are not restricted to those of any one class. Only one new power may be unlocked per owner. The coin's powers only function for a worthy owner, who must have at least 8 ranks in each of the six skills, plus 8 ranks in another skill. If the bearer of the coin is not a worthy owner (i.e., does not have enough skill ranks), the coin vanishes from the bearer's possession at the next new moon, reappearing elsewhere in Minkai to seek out a new owner. When a new owner first takes possession of the shinobi fuhonsen and activates a new power, the new ideogram (and its associated power) appears on the coin on a temporary basis, and the owner receives a vision of the coin's previous owners at the time of their deaths. If the new owner is not chaotic evil, he must immediately make a DC 25 Will save or his alignment shifts one step toward chaotic evil. If the save succeeds, the owner resists the change and can use the coin's powers until the next new moon, when he must make another save. The owner must make a new Will save at every new moon until his alignment becomes chaotic evil, or until the artifact is no longer in his possession. As long as the owner is not chaotic evil, he can simply discard the shinobi fuhonsen, at which point the coin vanishes at the next new moon. Once the owner becomes chaotic evil, the new ideogram (and its associated power) becomes permanent and he can no longer discard the coin, as if it were a cursed item. Each of the coin's powers can be activated by speaking the name of the corresponding ideogram, unless otherwise noted. The known powers (and their associated skills) of the shinobi fuhonsen are as follows. • Power #1 (Acrobatics): The owner can cast shadow walk once per day. • Power #2 (Climb): The owner can cast spider climb three times per day. • Power #3 (Disguise): The owner is permanently under the effects of misdirection. • Power #4 (Escape Artist): The owner can cast dimension door three times per day. • Power #5 (Perception): The owner can cast scrying once per day. • Power #6 (Stealth): The owner can cast mislead once per day. • Powers #7-8 (8 ranks in another skill): Yet to be discovered.",,,"Artifact","AP 53",,,,,,,,,,"The shinobi fuhonsen can be destroyed if it is swallowed by an ancient sovereign dragon (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3).

Carved from single pieces of polished darkwood, they often display markings or symbols sacred to the deity of their creator, but can just as easily be plain and smooth. Planting a voidstick into the ground with an appropriate prayer is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The device floods the area with negative energy, producing an effect identical to the desecrate spell in a 20- foot radius. In addition, any evil divine caster within 20 feet of the voidstick may cast her spells without the need for any material component with a value of 10 gp or less, or any focus item with a value of 50 gp or less. This ability functions only for the individual planting the voidstick and persists until the stick is uprooted. While this is a useful tool for shamans in locations poorly serviced by trade in magical goods, it pales in comparison to the voidstick's most potent function: the creation of undead. Creating a voidstick zombie requires an hour-long ritual during which foul symbols are drawn across a corpse's flesh. At the end of the hour, the creator must make a DC 25 Knowledge (religion) check before driving the first voidstick into the victim's heart. If this check succeeds, the victim is transformed into a voidstick zombie. To fully animate the creature, one voidstick must be used for each Hit Die the base creature has. In 12 rounds, the creature rises under its own power, eager to spread its negative energy and snuff out life nearby. Undead created using voidsticks are not under the control of their creator but can be commanded using channeled negative energy, spells, or similar effects. s can also be driven into a living body to slay the creature and transition it to undeath. If a living body is used, the creature must be pinned or otherwise helpless for the duration of the entire ritual. When the ritual is complete and the first voidstick is inserted, the creature must make a DC 18 Fortitude save. If this save succeeds, the creature is reduced to 0 hit points and is dying, but the magic of the voidstick and the ritual are wasted and the ritual must be performed again, using another voidstick. If the save fails, the creature dies and the ritual is successful, transforming the base creature into a voidstick zombie. Undead that contain such an item benefit from the +2 bonus hit points per Hit Die for having been created in the area of an enhanced desecrate spell.","Craft Wondrous Item, animate dead, desecrate, Creator must have 5 ranks in Knowledge (religion)","1,750 gp","Wondrous Item","AP 57",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"faint",1,2500,1750,,,"NULL",1089

When taken aboard an undamaged sailing vessel at sea, the model automatically reconfigures to become a perfect replica of the new ship. It takes 24 hours for the model to attune to the ship. A ship attuned to an impossible bottle takes half damage from all attacks that deal damage. The model ship in the impossible bottle absorbs the remaining damage, registering holes in its hull, rips in its sails, and scorch marks from fire. Once the attuned ship gains the broken condition, however, the impossible bottle ceases its protection, and any further attacks on the attuned ship deal full damage. If the attuned ship gains the sinking condition or is destroyed, the impossible bottle shatters and is permanently destroyed. If an impossible bottle was attuned to a damaged ship, once that ship has been fully repaired, the impossible bottle re-attunes itself over 24 hours and thereafter resumes its protection. An impossible bottle removed from its attuned ship ceases its protection, and must be re-attuned over 24 hours if brought back on board. If the bottle is shattered while it is attuned to a ship, the impossible bottle is destroyed and the attuned ship immediately takes 150 points of damage. Lastly, an impossible bottle can be used to repair an unattuned ship. As long as the bottle still functions, its owner can christen a vessel by smashing the impossible bottle against the ship's prow, releasing a wave of restorative magic that immediately repairs up to 150 points of damage to the vessel.","Craft Wondrous Item, make whole, shield other, shrink item, creator must have 5 ranks in the Craft (ships) skill","10,000 gp","Wondrous Item","AP 58",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,"faint",1,20000,10000,,,"NULL",1182

Some creators also build magical traps into paradox boxes (summon monster traps are particularly popular), but these traps are not included in the standard model. Once the proper command is given, a seam appears around the chest, and nested hinges within allow this lid to open, revealing an extradimensional space 1 cubic foot in size. Anything that will fit completely within that space (regardless of weight) can be successfully stored within, and the chest can be sealed again simply by closing it.

Paradox boxes were especially popular in Thassilon for their relative inexpensiveness as well as their superior security and durability. Many Thassilonian creators, burdened with arrogance and hubris, constructed their paradox boxes such that their surfaces were decorated with elaborate and carefully constructed riddles or wordplays that gave clues to their command words.

One face bears one of the seven Thassilonian runes for magic and sin, while the opposite side bears the image of a broken column. When carried, a whispering coin periodically haunts its carrier with soft whispers that seem to be in Thassilonian, but which are never loud enough to understand. These whispers are only slightly distracting, and in fact offer a boon to the carrier of the coin- they grant a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws against spells of the school of magic associated with the coin's rune (the coin found in this adventure bears the rune of lust, and thus grants a +1 resistance bonus against enchantment spells). Once per day, when the bearer flips the whispering coin and asks a question in Thassilonian while the coin is in the air, the coin provides an answer to the question as it lands, either ""yes"" (the Thassilonian rune) or ""no"" (the broken column); the word ""yes"" or ""no"" is also whispered into the user's ear as the answer is determined. A whispering coin's knowledge is limited to events that have a significant chance to affect the coin's carrier in the immediate future (no further out than a few minutes), and is further limited to facts, not conjecture. You could ask a whispering coin whether a door you were about to open is trapped, but not ""Is the king the mastermind of the conspiracy we just learned about?"" The GM, in other words, can determine whether or not a whispering coin can answer or not-if the coin can't answer, it spins on its edge upon landing for several seconds before flopping over to a random side and does not whisper a ""yes"" or ""no"" into the user's ear.

Once applied, the leeches persist for 8 hours before they die. The leeches are immediately destroyed if the wearer takes more than 20 points of damage from any area-effect energy damage. The jar automatically refills with a new batch of fortifying leeches after 24 hours. While the fortifying leeches are applied, a bloatmage immediately regains 2 bonus points to her blood pool-this cannot increase her blood points to higher than her normal maximum.

Once per month, the user can attempt to use a crystal ball of the dark void to contact a flying creature from the depths of space called a shantak (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 244). The user must attempt at a DC 25 Spellcraft check. If the attempt to contact a shantak is successful, the monster flies to the location where the user was when contact was made. It arrives there in 3d20 hours, at which point the user must use Diplomacy or magic to compel the shantak to serve him. Failure to do so (or failure to meet the shantak) causes the angry shantak to remain in the area for 2d6 hours, attacking anything that comes near. Every time a crystal ball of the dark void is used, there's a 5% chance that the item doesn't work as intended and instead reveals glimpses of alien horrors from the depths of the Dark Tapestry to the user, who must immediately attempt a DC 20 Will save to avoid taking 1d4 points of Wisdom drain.","Craft Wondrous Item, scrying, sending","30,000 gp","Wondrous Item","AP 65",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"moderate",7,60000,30000,,,"NULL",2622

As these collars are relatively costly, they are typically reserved for use on particularly powerful or desirable slaves. A slave collar consists of a simple ring of metal (typically brass or bronze) that latches in place with a lock. Many feature additional adornments like short lengths of chain. Each slave collar's lock is attuned to a unique key. The person who carries a collar's key is aware of that collar's wearer as if it were the target of a constant status spell. In addition, the key carrier can communicate telepathically with the wearer of the collar as long as the wearer is within 100 feet of her. As long as a slave collar is worn, that collar's key carrier automatically penetrates the collar wearer's spell resistance (if any), and the collared creature takes a -5 penalty on all saving throws against the key carrier's spells. A slave collar's lock can be picked with a successful DC 40 Disable Device check, or broken open with a successful DC 30 Strength check-either method immediately destroys the slave collar.

During the time of Azlant, dozens of flamma horacalcums existed, each of which had to be encased in an orrery-like container made of horacalcum to prevent the flame from burning away into another time. The flame itself is weightless, but the orrery that contains it weighs 7 pounds, and requires a free hand to carry and utilize. As a free action, a flamma horacalcum's level of illumination can be adjusted by its carrier's thought to range from the brightness of a single candle to that shed by a daylight spell. This light is considered to be from a 9th-level spell for the purposes of overcoming magical darkness. Once the flamma horacalcum is set down, it continues to radiate its last level of light. This light bends and warps time in slight ways for its carrier, granting her a +4 bonus on all initiative checks. Three times per day, the flame can be commanded to cast a haste spell as a swift action. The carrier can also use the flame as a standard action to unleash a thin beam of fire equivalent to a searing light. A creature hit by this effect is slowed, as per the spell, for 1d4 rounds if it fails at a DC 20 Will save. Once per week as a standard action, the user of a flamma horacalcum can blow the flame out, snuffing it entirely. This triggers a time stop effect on the user that lasts for 1d4 rounds, after which the flame reignites.

"Ghost Iron Scimitar","strong transmutation",20,"weapon","162,315 gp","8 lbs.","When Xin learned that the runelords had invested their champions with the swords known as the Alara'hai-the Swords of Sin-he decided that he deserved such a weapon for his champion as well. Unfortunately, his attempt to create an eighth Alara'hai failed. Despite his skill and power, Xin simply couldn't equal even the least of the other Swords of Sin, a truth that vexed and humiliated him. The weapon he created, the ghost iron scimitar, was a significant weapon, but it was hardly an artifact. It wasn't even intelligent. Ashamed of the weapon, but secretly harboring the hope that someday he'd figure out how to improve it, Xin secreted the sword away in a Skymetal Vault and forgot about it. The ghost iron scimitar is a +2 dancing keen ghost touch inubrix scimitar. The weapon has been magically enhanced so that it still deals normal weapon damage for its size and is not treated as being broken, despite being made from a soft skymetal. It ignores armor and shield bonuses granted by metal objects. Although the weapon cannot damage metal creatures (and is thus not very effective against the clockwork reliquary), it can be presented to the clockwork reliquary as an example of one of Xin's failures to aid in triggering its unstable mind.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, animate objects, keen edge, plane shift","100,315 gp","Weapon","AP 66",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"strong",8,162315,100315,,"+2 dancing keen ghost touch inubrix scimitar","NULL",2640
"Guardian Key","strong enchantment",15,"none",90000,"1 lb.","This simple-looking key seems to be carved crudely from stone, but is in fact a sort of skeleton key that can be used to wind all clockwork constructs swiftly and efficiently. Originally, the key allowed the carrier to command limitless numbers of clockworks simultaneously. With this key, Xin could command his entire clockwork army effortlessly, and its use was key to his power over Thassilon. But when Xin used it as an element in the clockwork reliquary's construction, the key's powers were vastly diminished. Xin accepted this as a necessity, since if all had gone according to plan, he would still be able to command his army using his new body. The diminished key can be recovered from the destroyed reliquary's remains. The guardian key can fit into any clockwork construct's keyhole, and fully winds a clockwork with a single turn made as a move action. Clockworks wound by the guardian key are healed of 5d8+20 points of damage, remain active for 10 times longer than they normally would, and during this period gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. The guardian key can also be used to seize control of a clockwork. To do so, a creature must attempt a touch attack against the target clockwork as a standard action. If it hits, the clockwork can attempt a DC 15 Will save to resist. If the clockwork's save fails, that clockwork regards the key's carrier as its creator, and follows that person's commands to the letter-provided the commands are spoken in Thassilonian.

"Sihedron","overwhelming (all schools)",25,"none",,"7 lbs.","The Sihedron is a seven-pointed star that symbolizes the power of Thassilonian magic. Xin created the Sihedron as more than just a symbol of his power over the schools of magic he'd defined for his nation, though. It was initially meant to be a badge of his power over all of Thassilon, and a symbol of the unified nature of the nation's peoples. Each of the Sihedron's arms is made of a different skymetal, symbolizing how the nation of Thassilon was made of different races-Azlanti, Varisian, Shoanti, giant, elf, and others. Xin went further than merely making the Sihedron a symbol of harmony and diversity, though, and built into its functionality significant advantages when the artifact is shared among a number of allies. The powers granted by the Sihedron are greatest when it is used not by a lone individual, but by a group that works together toward a common goal, and whose members trust each other enough to effortlessly pass control of the powerful item between themselves swiftly and without a second thought. Alas, Xin's ideals for the diversity of Thassilon were misplaced, and even as his rule continued, he found himself increasingly paranoid and unwilling to share the powers granted by the Sihedron. The fact that the item was intended to be a powerful shared artifact but has never properly been used in this manner is one of the greatest ironies of Thassilon. The Sihedron itself is a relatively plain-looking item. The seven different hues of its composite metals help to give it some color, but the artifact lacks any of the decorative runes and markings that are so common on other Thassilonian artifacts. Even the artifact itself, built in the image of the sign of Lissala and the rune for the Thassilonian schools of magic, seems somewhat plain, lacking the Sihedron rune's distinctive hooklike shapes along its arms. In fact, these hooks are represented in the device by the placement of the seven ioun stone receptacles. Once the Sihedron is activated, it glows with a warm yellow light that sheds illumination as if via a daylight spell. To activate the Sihedron, a person need only touch the center of the star where all seven arms meet and concentrate as a swift action-the Sihedron immediately rises up into the air behind the user's head like a halo and floats along behind him wherever he goes, even teleporting along with him. Although the Sihedron is not in physical contact with the user, it is in all ways treated as if it were an attended object being held or carried. The Sihedron implants knowledge of all its powers and how to activate them into the mind of anyone who activates it in this way. Once activated, the Sihedron protects its user in a number of ways. First, it constantly infuses the wearer with magical energy, granting him fast healing 5. Second, it grants the user the constant effects of a foresight spell (providing a +2 insight bonus to AC and on Reflex saves, and preventing the user from ever being surprised or flat-footed). Third, up to once per day, the Sihedron can target its wearer with true resurrection the instant he is slain-he need not activate this power, as the Sihedron automatically triggers if the user is killed. When the user activates the Sihedron, he may select one of the star's points to be ""ascendant."" The Sihedron rotates so that this point is pointing upward, and he immediately gains an additional defense and the use of a spell-like ability, usable at will, as detailed below. The user may change which point is ascendant as a standard action by concentrating, but cannot change the point to an ""oppositional"" point. The effects granted by each of the Sihedron's points (as well as the two oppositional points for each) are listed at the end of this item description. As an immediate action (but no more often than once during any single combat round), the current user of the Sihedron may cause the artifact to instantaneously transfer itself to another willing creature within 120 feet. The Sihedron teleports from the current user and appears behind the head of the target creature. As it does so, it unleashes a surge of potent magic that affects both of these creatures, granting a +2 insight bonus on all saving throws for 1 round and healing each creature of 2d8+10 points of damage. This transfer occurs so quickly that it can grant the bonus on a saving throw after the saving throw itself has been rolled, but it must be made before the result of that role is confirmed by the GM. Likewise, the healing granted can occur in the instant before a creature actually takes damage from any source, which could heal a heavily wounded target before the additional damage renders it unconscious or even kills it. When the Sihedron is granted to a new target in this manner, the new target can automatically select which point of the Sihedron is ascendant, even if the point selected is oppositional to the previously active point. Each of the Sihedron's arms contains an ioun stone embedded in a small receptacle. These ioun stones cannot be removed as long as the Sihedron is whole, and they help to power the following additional abilities when one of the points is ascendant. Charity: Grants a +4 insight bonus to AC and dimensional anchor as a spell-like ability. Opposed by kindness and temperance. Generosity: Grants a +4 insight bonus on attack rolls and beast shape II as a spell-like ability. Opposed by humility and love. Humility: Grants a +8 insight bonus on skill checks and greater invisibility as a spell-like ability. Opposed by generosity and zeal.

"Cloud Castle Of The Storm King","strong (all schools)",20,"none",,0,"Once the fortress of a legendary tyrant known only as the Storm King, this castle now wanders the known universe, sometimes at the whim of its master, but often as a drifting and aimless haunt of powerful monsters, ignorant of-or unable to tap into-its fantastic power. This grand and opulent castle is held aloft and propelled by a foundation of storm clouds constantly rumbling with thunder and crackling with electrical storms. Atop the massive storm cloud, the castle is shaped like a square, with 80-foot guard towers at each corner. At its center is a 140-foot tower with seven levels and more than 30 chambers. The central tower is well appointed with many halls, living chambers, suites, privies, kitchens (with pantries that magically replenish food stores every fortnight), and laboratories suitable for arcane and alchemical study. Each guard tower has living chambers and barracks for up to 25 guards, and one tower has an adjoining stable that can hold up to a dozen griffons, hippogriffs, pegasi, or even terrestrial mounts. In all, the tower can comfortably support a population of 300 Medium creatures. Though created by the legendary Storm King millennia ago, the cloud castle has had several masters since he mysteriously disappeared over a thousand years ago. Many believe the Storm King ascended to godhood, while others believe he was captured and imprisoned by a rival, a demon lord, or even a deity wishing to remove a threat, which may mean that the Storm King will one day return to reclaim his castle. In order to fully take control of the castle, a creature must be at least 17th level, and must have the Leadership feat and 17 ranks in Knowledge (arcana). If the castle already has a master, that master must be defeated before another can take her place. The castle's movement is controlled by way of a control chamber located at the heart (a central chamber on its 4th floor). There, a font of pure elemental water serves as a scrying device for the castle's master, though it can only view places inside the castle or within 100 feet of it. The master (or a person she designates) can direct the castle's motion from within the chamber. It has a fly speed of 250 feet (clumsy) and uses the Fly skill modifier of the person controlling its motion; the castle can hover without needing to make a Fly check and never risks falling due to a failed check. When not being controlled, the castle moves randomly, sometimes changing direction every minute, sometimes holding the same course for days at a time, but always avoiding the ground or other hazards. It has been known to travel to other planes, though no master other than the Storm King is known to have invoked this power. The master of the castle gains the following spell-like abilities: • Call lightning storm 1/day. The master must be in the control chamber or one of the towers to use this ability. • Guards and wards 1/day on the central tower. • Storm of vengeance 1/day. The master must be in the control chamber to use this ability, and the storm rains down from the castle's cloudy base upon everything within range underneath (2,200 feet). • Wind wall at will.

This blasphemous book consists of numerous scattered chapters divided into three volumes-daemonic, demonic, and diabolic. Should all chapters of those three volumes be united in their entirety, the completed compilation exhibits the following abilities. The complete Book of the Damned radiates a permanent unhallow effect in a 150-foot radius and a sympathy effect tuned to attract all evil creatures.

Finally, any creatures that make use of any of the tome's abilities are damned, condemned to one of the Lower Planes after death regardless of their deeds.

The bearer gains a +10 bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks whenever she consults the book for 1 hour regarding a question. Additionally, the book's descriptions of Abaddon, the Abyss, and Hell prove so vivid that any teleportation to or within those planes always brings the caster to the desired location (no familiarity roll needed). The bearer of the Book of the Damned also gains a +5 bonus on the opposed Charisma check required by the planar binding spell (this bonus stacks with the +5 bonus the tome grants on interactions with evil outsiders).

"Dancing Hut Of Baba Yaga","overwhelming conjuration and transmutation",30,"none",,"3,500 lbs.","Approximately 15 feet tall and 15 feet square, this crude hut rises atop a pair of gigantic chicken legs that, when not tucked beneath the structure at rest, endlessly pick and scratch at the hut's surroundings. The lifelike legs aren't the only thing that make the hut remarkable, though. The small building's only door opens into a room more than twice the size of what the structure could naturally contain, but this remarkable space is but a threshold to places more wondrous still, for it is merely one possible configuration of countless extradimensional rooms (see page 23 for a map of this ""default"" layout of the hut's interior). Nothing that transpires outside the hut has any effect on those inside. The properties and abilities of the Dancing Hut are divided into two categories, the defensive and the transportive. Defensive: At its most basic level, the Dancing Hut is a unique CR 17 construct. The statistics and abilities of this remarkable creation are detailed on the following pages. A creature inside the hut can command the structure to move, attack, use its special abilities, or immediately perform any other function it is capable of by employing the Dancing Hut's unusual controls, which consist of a brown hen's egg inside a simple, cracked clay bowl sitting upon a table inside the hut. Both the bowl and egg can easily be removed or destroyed, but both reappear 1 hour later and only function within the confines of the hut. Breaking the egg reveals the head of live and very irate rooster that dies a long, squawking death-and disappears an hour later when the controls reform. Any creature that makes a successful DC 30 Use Magic Device check can use these innocuous controls to command the Dancing Hut. Failing this check causes the hut to dance erratically, potentially trampling creatures nearby, but has no effect on creatures inside the hut. A creature must succeed at a new Use Magic Device check every round to directly control the hut's actions. The hut can be assigned simple, standing commands to follow, such as to attack any humanoid that approaches, to patrol an area, to head in a direction for a set period, or to flee if damaged, but nothing complicated that requires it to follow multipart instructions, recognize specific individuals, or seek a specific place. Transportive: As a construct, the Dancing Hut can physically move on its own, but it also possesses the ability to slip between planes and even travel to other planets, carrying any inside the hut with it. This remarkable ability is activated using the cauldron within the hut, which links the hut to countless-if not infinite-locations across the planes. To use these transportive abilities, a creature must stand before the hut's cauldron, place two ingredients inside, and stir the everbubbling stew within-a process requiring a full-round action, though finding the desired ingredients might take longer. The two ingredients act as ""keys"" to a specific destination. Each destination the hut can travel to has a specific combination, or ""recipe,"" of two keys, which appear to be relatively normal items stored throughout the hut itself. Although the keys appear to be absolutely mundane, only those specific items within the hut function as keys. So while a red apple might be one key, it must be the red apple found inside the Dancing Hut, not just any apple. Like the hut's controls, keys can easily be destroyed or removed from the hut, but they reappear 1 hour later. Once the proper keys have been placed in the cauldron, the Dancing Hut immediately appears at its new destination, as if it had traveled there via plane shift or interplanetary teleport (The Inner Sea World Guide). The hut always appears in the same location at a given destination-the keys are tied to that specific location at the destination. Once at a destination, the Dancing Hut can move (or be moved) to any other location on that world or plane normally. Once the hut arrives at its new destination, the keys immediately disappear from the cauldron, reforming elsewhere in the hut. Each time a new combination of keys is used to transport the Dancing Hut to a new location, the interior layout of the hut changes, as each location the hut can travel to has its own corresponding layout of the hut's interior. The map on page 23 depicts a sample layout for the hut's interior, but as the hut travels, this layout can change dramatically, though every layout contains one room with a cauldron and the hut's controls, regardless of how many rooms are present in that layout. When the hut's layout changes, the other layouts still exist, and are inaccessible from within the hut itself. Magic such as plane shift can still be used to visit these otherwise inaccessible layouts, and Baba Yaga herself (and perhaps some other residents of the hut as well) can freely travel throughout all of the rooms of the hut, regardless of the hut's physical location. The table above presents a list of some of the best-known destinations the hut can travel to, along with the two keys needed to take the hut to that location. This list is by no means all-inclusive, and none-save perhaps Baba Yaga herself-know the limits of the hut's transportive properties.",,,"Artifact","Artifacts & Legends",,,,,,,,,,"If the cauldron inside the Dancing Hut is used to open a gate within the cauldron itself, a rift in reality opens, destroying the hut's extradimensional interior and sucking in the exterior frame-likely destroying whoever activated the cauldron, and some posit much more than that.

The silver-and-gold frame is equally elegant and etched with faintly glowing arcane symbols. The painting is a powerful minor artifact that can be used to create one or more duplicates of any living creature that has a Charisma score of at least 10. By touching the painting and uttering a command word, the subject creature is drawn into the painting and appears seated in the chair. The subject is under the effects of a binding spell. Delving into the subconscious mind, the painting creates a duplicate of the subject that lasts for 1 day per Hit Die the creature possesses. If the subject creature has a positive Charisma modifier, additional duplicates equal to its Charisma modifier may be created. Each of these duplicates represents an alter ego of the subject. Some beings may have multiple alter egos. In this case, the subject creature determines exactly how many id duplicates he wants the id portrait to create, up to a maximum determined by his Charisma modifier. An id duplicate can be of a different class from the subject creature, and it has average hit points for that class, the same number of Hit Dice as the subject creature, and the same basic knowledge and goals as the subject creature (modified by any ability score changes).

When first given to a creature, the necklace recognizes members of the creature's race and gender-but not a specific individual- as its owner. The owner automatically fails any saving throw made to resist the effects of divination magic, but the necklace seeks to protect the owner against danger, reactively casting spells to defend its wearer against effects that compromise her control. The spells the amulet can cast (and when it does so) include freedom (in response to imprisonment, petrification, paralysis, and similar effects described by this spell), greater dispel magic (in response to any fear or mind-affecting effect), remove curse (in response to curses), protection from chaos (in response to any form of possession or similar control). The wearer has no control over when these spells are cast and the target of these spells is always the wearer. The Invidian Eye can cast each spell 3 times per day.

"Lens Of Galundari","overwhelming abjuration",22,"none",,"10 lbs.","At its most basic level, the Lens of Galundari functions as the focal point for an inward-facing magic circle spell of the user's choice. The magic circle varies in radius, but can hold one outsider called into its space by the spell planar binding, regardless of its size. While the lens improves the effectiveness of the spell planar binding, it does not actually cast the spell, requiring some outside agency to cast the spell while employing the lens as an additional focus component. The target of the planar binding receives its normal Will save to resist, but once it appears within the lens's magic circle, it cannot escape-the lens prevents the outsider from using its spell resistance or Charisma to escape, and locks it in place as per the spell dimensional anchor. Once trapped within the lens's magic circle, an outsider is trapped indefinitely, until it agrees to the user's demands or a sentient creature touches the prison with intent to free the outsider-doing so releases the outsider immediately. Even rolls of 1 on Charisma checks to coerce the outsider into service do not free the outsider. While the lens does not grant the user a bonus on Charisma checks made to influence creatures trapped within its prison, it does grant the user an additional use for the outsider: The outsider can be bound within the lens, transforming the artifact into an arcane engine of sorts. The user must compel the outsider to submit to this service, as described by the spell planar binding. The outsider receives a +10 bonus on the opposed Charisma check made to resist entering into service. This bonus is reduced by 1 for every week the outsider remains bound (minimum 0). The lens can only hold one outsider at a time, and it cannot employ its magic circle effect while an outsider is trapped within. If an outsider agrees to be bound into the lens, it becomes trapped inside the lens and cannot free itself. While bearing the lens, the wielder can employ any of the outsider's spell-like abilities. How often the wielder can use these spell-like abilities is limited by the outsider's Hit Dice and the frequency with which the imprisoned outsider can normally use its spell-like abilities. The outsider's Hit Dice become a pool of soul points the wielder has access to, with each Hit Die equating to 1 soul point. The lens's bearer can employ the imprisoned outsider's spell-like abilities by spending a number of soul points equal to the spell-like ability's spell level. If the lens no longer has enough soul points to pay for a spell-like ability's use, the ability cannot be used. If the imprisoned outsider can only use a spell-like ability a certain number of times in an amount of time, the wielder cannot employ that spell-like ability more than that number of times in the amount of time specified, even if the lens has enough soul points to pay for the ability's use. The lens's total number of soul points replenishes every day. The outsider within the lens can be freed by spending 1 soul point.

If it fails, the outsider takes 12d6 points of damage and becomes nauseated for 1 hour. An outsider that remains inside a building warded in this manner must make a new Will save each round to avoid damage and nausea. The effect is lessened against non-outsider evil creatures, but they too are affected-such creatures gain a +4 bonus on their Will saves, take only 4d6 points of damage on a failed save, and are nauseated for only 1 minute.

A maleficus spike consumes an enormous amount of magical energy. It contains enough energy to ward a structure for 24 hours, after which it becomes dormant until recharged. Recharging a maleficus spike requires a spellcaster to spend 10 minutes in contact with the spike, after which the spellcaster selects a number of spell slots totaling no fewer than 24 spell levels to expend to infuse the artifact with enough energy to ward the structure for another 24 hours.

For most, this means an excruciating, spell-blasted death; for a small fraction of others, this means a typically brief but painful existence as a failed lich; but for an exceedingly rare few, this means something in between. A phylactery of the failed has a minute chance of coming into being anytime a spellcaster attempts to achieve lichdom and fails (equivalent to 1 in 100). In such cases, the magic-user's body is destroyed, but the phylactery he prepared remains and is invested with a remnant of his shattered consciousness.

Each day at sunrise, the gem rotates to display a different facet. The active facet determines the ring's power for that day. Each day, roll 1d10 on the Ring of Nine Facets Powers table to determine which facet-and thus which power-is active. The wearer of the ring can, with a great deal of mental exertion, attempt to change the active facet away from one she does not desire. The gem can only be turned in a particular order that shifts the active facet to the next highest facet, and each facet is a particular number of steps away from one another (see the Ring of Nine Facets Powers table). To change the facet, the wearer must succeed at a Wisdom check as a full-round action, and the wearer takes nonlethal damage, regardless of success. The DC of the Wisdom check to turn the gem is 15 + 5 per 1-step increase, while the nonlethal damage dealt equals 1d6 per 1-step increase.

In addition to the damage this weapon deals, any creature struck by the scepter ages a number of years equal to the damage taken. On a critical hit, not only does the scepter deal greater damage, but the victim ages 2 years for every point of damage taken. Creatures aged in this manner might have their physical ability scores reduced; consult Table 7-2 on page 169 of the Core Rulebook for the effects of aging on common humanoids. For the wide range of unlisted humanoids and non-humanoids this aging might affect, GMs should use their judgment, general knowledge, and creature descriptions to decide how the effects of aging apply on a race-by-race basis. GMs looking for a quick way to approximate the ages of minor opponents should alter Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution by -1 for every 10 years aged and consider +40 years to be a creature's maximum age. Any creature aged to greater than its maximum age immediately dies. Constructs, outsiders, and undead are immune to the effects of aging. The mental abilities of those affected by this form of aging do not increase. Creatures that gain abilities dependant on their age gain these abilities as normal (though, at the GM's discretion, these abilities might not be immediately usable). The spell regenerate restores 1 year of premature aging for every hit point it heals. Creatures killed by aging can only be restored by true resurrection, miracle, or wish, but even these spells do not heal aging, returning the target to life only 1 year younger than his maximum age. In addition to its use as a weapon, the Scepter of Ages can open a portal through time. To do this, the scepter's bearer must spend 10 minutes precisely aligning the delicate mechanisms within the artifact's head to the exact dates she wishes to travel to. This requires the bearer to make either a DC 30 Knowledge (history) check to program a precise date or a DC 30 Wisdom check to travel to a general period. The bearer can rush through calibrating the scepter, activating it in 1 minute, but doing so increases the associated DCs by +10. Regardless of whether or not this check is successful, a 5-foot-wide glowing tear in time opens within 15 feet. This rift cannot be used as a weapon or to destructive effect. What time the passage opens to is determined by whether the bearer succeeds at the check (opening a portal to the desired time) or fails (opening a portal to the incorrect time, determined by how significantly he failed, as shown on the Accidental Time Travel Results table on page 43). The time beyond the portal cannot be viewed and can only be discovered by passing completely through. The rift remains open for 1 minute before closing.

All allies within 100 feet of the bearer gain the effect of bless and prayer. Additionally, all allies within 100 feet of the bearer know his relative position and condition, as per the spell status. Beyond these properties, the Shield of Aroden is designed to protect its bearer from death. Any attack that would kill the bearer (not merely make him unconscious or dying) triggers this ability, redirecting the lethal attack fully upon the shield and leaving the bearer unharmed (even if the attack normally only works on living creatures). For example, if the bearer failed a saving throw against flesh to stone, the shield would turn to stone and shatter instead, whereas if the bearer failed his save against horrid wilting, the shield would turn to dry splinters.

Each is an intelligent artifact largely in control of itself. A totem radiates an aura that forces all non-worshipers of Angazhan within 30 feet to make a successful DC 15 Will save or become panicked for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. A totem can also make use of its own spell-like abilities as it pleases, frequently lashing out with weird to attack. Its size and direct connection to Angazhan's power prevents it from easily being used by other creatures. Any who would employ its powers must touch the totem. Those who aren't chaotic evil worshipers of Angazhan must also enter into a contest of wills with the totem to make use of its powers for that day (see page 535 of the Core Rulebook). If a creature wins the contest, that creature can direct the totem to use its abilities. Additionally, the creature is immune to the totem's panic aura for 24 hours and the totem cannot use its spell-like abilities against the creature for that day. Once per day, a totem of Angazhan can reincarnate a single creature that dies within 30 feet of it. Unlike the spell of the same name, the reincarnated creature always returns to life as a chaotic evil charau-ka (The Inner Sea World Guide). A creature reincarnated as a charau-ka gains +4 Str, +2 Dex, and +4 Con. Once per year, the totem may instead use its reincarnate ability to bring a creature back to life as a chaotic evil dire ape-it is this ability that creates the creatures that go on to become Gorilla Kings. A creature reincarnated as a dire ape gains +8 Str, +4 Dex, and +6 Con. When a new dire ape champion is created, it becomes infused with a desire to seek out the current Gorilla King and challenge him to a fight to the death-the survivor rules as the Gorilla King for another year. As with all reincarnate effects, the creature being restored to life must be willing for the effect to work-the creature to be reincarnated knows that accepting the offer to come back to life enslaves its soul to Angazhan (resulting in the shift to chaotic evil and the drive to seek out and replace the current Gorilla King). If a totem of Angazhan is placed upon or adjacent to an altar of Angazhan that is under the effect of an unhallow spell cast by a worshiper of Angazhan, the totem of Angazhan's sensory range extends to 300 feet, and it can use its abilities in this extended range as long as it has line of sight to its target.",,,"Artifact","Artifacts & Legends","CE",7,14,13,18,"empathy","30 ft. hearing and tremorsense, true seeing",,,"A totem of Angazhan can be destroyed only by a Gorilla King (either acting on his own volition or while under the effects of magical control), who can damage the totem as if it were a normal item with hardness 8 and 100 hit points (or by succeeding at a DC 30 Strength check to break the totem in half ). Of course, once a Gorilla King makes his first attack upon one of these totems, the blasphemy against Angazhan causes that Gorilla King to no longer count as a worshiper of Angazhan, and he can now be affected by the totem's panic aura. Worse, the affront allows the totem of Angazhan to attempt once per round to revoke that Gorilla King's reincarnated body.

As a standard action, you may charge the ring with a +1 profane bonus by sacrificing 2 of your hit points. These hit points remain lost and cannot be healed by any means until the ring's power is expended. You may do this multiple times, up to a maximum of a +5 profane bonus stored in the ring. As an immediate action, you can add the stored profane bonus to any single attack roll, damage roll, skill check, or saving throw, which expends the charged energy from the ring. You must declare this use after rolling the die but before you learn the result of the roll. You must expend all the ring's power at once. Once the charge is expended, you can heal your lost hit points normally. Expending this charge does not ruin the ring, and you may charge it again by sacrificing more hit points. The charge in the ring can come from multiple donors, but none of the donors can regain their sacrificed hit points until the ring's charge is spent or the ring is destroyed.

The daemonic chapters of the Book of the Damned are bound between covers of perpetually frozen and compressed ashes that seem to suck away ambient light into their material. All known copies of the text appear to be some variety of palimpsest, with the words written over the intentionally erased words of an earlier draft, though it is unknown when and by whom this redaction took place. In each case, the edited portions describe specific names relating to the earliest history of the plane, sometimes with entire pages being censored. Scholars suspect this is related to the same magic utilized by the Horsemen to scour their own records and history in cycles when one of the Four has been replaced. Any good-aligned creature who touches this section of the Book of the Damned gains one negative level. This level cannot be restored until the character has remained more than 10 feet away from the book for 24 hours. Creatures attempting to read the book that are not neutral evil must make a DC 15 Will save or have their alignment permanently take one step toward neutral evil. Written in a mixture of Abyssal and Infernal, sometimes changing from one to the other mid-sentence, the text requires true fluency in both languages to fully understand the nuances and true meaning of the text. As a reader proceeds, he becomes aware of a dull pressure on the back of his skull and a buzzing static. Eventually the text begins to ""speak"" to him, inserting telepathic impressions and images to complement the text. A telepathic creature may ""read"" the text without actually opening the book merely by holding it and concentrating. A reader who splashes his own blood onto the book (which is promptly absorbed) and spends 30 days (not necessarily consecutively) reading the book receives several benefits. The book contains copies of every spell with the evil descriptor, as well as all of the spells on pages 38-39 and those listed below. The user gains at +4 bonus on all Knowledge (planes) checks when using the book as a resource (consulting it for at least an hour regarding a question), and its descriptions of Abaddon are so accurate that any teleportation to or within that plane always brings the caster to the desired location (no familiarity roll needed). Any energy-draining spell cast by the bearer bestows +1 additional negative level on affected creatures. The daemonic portion of the Book of the Damned serves as the focal point for a permanent unhallow effect and sympathy attuned to attract neutral evil creatures. As long as the book is carried, its owner casts all evil spells as if he were two caster levels higher and gains a +2 bonus on all Charisma-based skills and checks when interacting with neutral evil creatures. Four times per day, the tome can be used to cast one of the following spells: blasphemy, circle of death, energy drain, death knell, soul bind, or soul transfer (see page 39).

Treerazer can call Blackaxe to his hand as a free action, despite any intervening distance, as long as Blackaxe is not kept in an area that prevents teleportation effects from occurring. The nascent demon lord often loans Blackaxe to favored minions, and uses this ability to reclaim his weapon should he become aware that the wielder has failed in a mission. While Blackaxe is wielded by another creature, Treerazer always knows that creature's location and status (as via the status and discern location spells), and by concentrating can observe the world around the wielder as if using that wielder's senses. While in this state, Treerazer may use any of his spell-like abilities through the link, treating Blackaxe as if it were the source of the spell-like ability.

"Charm of Aluum Control","moderate transmutation",20,"neck","20,000 gp",0,"This pendant holds a glowing crystal etched with faint runes. Created by the pactmasters of Katapesh to manipulate and control their constructs known as aluums, these charms are much sought after on the black market. Unauthorized possession of a charm of aluum control is considered a grave crime in Katapesh, punishable by decades of imprisonment, exile, or even death. Each charm of aluum control is attuned to a single, specific aluum, but the magic of the charm allows it to function somewhat against other aluums as well. Against its specific attuned aluum, the charm grants you the ability to command that construct as if you were using dominate person on a humanoid creature. This effect functions against other aluums, but non-attuned aluums gain a DC 16 Will save to resist the effect. If an aluum fails such a save, it becomes attuned to that charm and the previous aluum becomes unattuned-a single charm of aluum control can only be attuned to one aluum at a time. For purposes of this effect, ordering an aluum to attack a Pactmaster or someone who appears to be part of Katapesh's government or army or to damage any structure in the city of Katapesh counts as an action against the aluum's nature and allows the aluum a new saving throw with a +2 bonus to resist the charm's effects.

"Shield of Aroden","strong abjuration",20,"none",,"10 lbs.","During the battle between the Whispering Tyrant and General Arnisant, the lich unleashed terrible magic upon the outnumbered mortal army. Despite the lich's power, Arnisant was protected from the onslaught by his magical shield, an artifact known as the Shield of Aroden. When the two finally faced off, the Whispering Tyrant attempted to use a wish to summon Arnisant's heart to his waiting claws. The Shield of Aroden prevented this dire fate and instead shattered into a dozen fragments, one of which appeared in Tar-Baphon's hand, fusing with the undead flesh and burning the lich with holy fire. When the flames subsided, the crippled lich was soon locked away in the dungeons beneath Gallowspire, there to rot for all eternity. The Shield of Aroden lost all of its power. Its broken remnants have been passed down from one watcher-lord to another without fail. Some say that should the Whispering Tyrant ever become free, the missing piece of the shield would have to be recovered from his bony claw for the fiend to truly be defeated. This item is normally kept on display in the city of Vigil in Lastwall, though at first glance it is just a collection of wooden shards on a large black silk pillow. If assembled, these 12 shards would form a round shield with a piece in the center missing. The shield's face is carved to look like Aroden's holy symbol-a winged eye in a circle. Originally known as the Shield of Aroden, most today call it by its new name-the Shattered Shield of Arnisant. If restored to its former glory (a task that could in and of itself be a campaign), the Shattered Shield becomes the Shield of Aroden once again-a +5 light fortification spell resistance (17) heavy wooden shield. Once per day, you can invoke a form of fire shield that protects against cold attacks and damages opponents with fire and holy damage like a flame strike (it is likely that this ability is what burned the lich in his final battle). Once per round as an immediate action, if an adjacent ally is hit by a ranged or melee attack, you can use the shield to redirect the attack to yourself, suffering all effects from that attack as if you were its intended target. All allies within 100 feet of you gain the effect of bless and prayer. As with a status spell, all allies within 100 feet know your relative position and condition. The Shield of Aroden bestows two negative levels on any chaotic creature that attempts to wield it. The negative levels remain as long as the shield is held or carried. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the creature holds or carries the shield.",,,"Artifact","Inner Sea World Guide",,,,,,,,,,"The Shield of Aroden has the special purpose of protecting its bearer from death no matter the consequences to itself. Any attack that would kill you (not merely make you unconscious or dying) triggers this ability, redirecting the attack fully upon the shield and leaving you unharmed, even if the attack normally only works on living creatures. For example, if you failed a saving throw against flesh to stone, the shield would turn to stone instead of you, whereas if you failed your save against horrid wilting or implosion, the shield would turn to dry splinters or crushed pulp. Depending on the nature of the attack, it may be impossible to reassemble or restore the shield to full functionality again. Any attempt to repair the shield requires all of its pieces, and barring the direct intercession of a deity, it is likely that any repairs would be imperfect. Anytime the bearer fails a saving throw by rolling a 1, the shield must attempt the same saving throw (regardless whether the shield would normally be the item to suffer the effects of failure), and if it fails by rolling 1, it shatters again, perhaps with disastrous effects.

A single dose of sun orchid elixir cannot stop the aging process, but it does the next-best thing-it restores youth.

All penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution the drinker may have suffered as a result of advanced age are removed, but all bonuses to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma that result from advanced age remain (although as the character ages again into middle age and beyond, he does not gain any of these bonuses a second time). Vanity-seekers go to nearly any length to acquire the elixir, resorting to bribery, extortion, and murder. To curtail such troubles in the land of its creation, the use of the elixir is outlawed in Thuvia (except by the formula's creator).

The invention of the first wardstones, giant menhirs infused with holy magic meant to contain and repel demonic creatures, was perhaps the greatest result of the crusader's initial response to Sarkoris's destruction. Today, dozens of wardstones stand sentinel along the borders of the Worldwound. The primary purpose of the wardstones is to contain the growing influence of the Worldwound itself, but they also exude a powerful field similar to that generated by a forbiddance spell. A single wardstone exerts this aura in a 300-foot radius, but when multiple wardstones are linked (as in the case of those running along the border of the Worldwound), they create a 300-footwide path of forbiddance, with the wardstones running down the middle. The forbiddance area, be it a radius or path, deals 12d6 points of damage per round to any demon within that area (DC 18 Will save half; spell resistance applies). Teleportation effects do not function in this zone at all. The wardstones that bolster the eastern and southern borders of the Worldwound have a further effect as well-focused on the Worldwound as they are, they prevent demons from teleporting into or out of the Worldwound and effectively contain the threat.

The ancient Azlanti created the celestial lens to capture the light of sacred eclipses and solar conjunctions, as well as the refracted darkness found between stars. Celestial rays can be directed in an extremely powerful beam of energy that manifests as a vertical column of searing energy blasts focused directly below the celestial lens.

During the day, half the damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks. At night, the device focuses distant starlight, and the maximum damage is only 10d6, although the lens does not function at all for 1 hour before sunrise and 1 hour after sunset. The lens moves with a constant speed of 20 feet and damages everything caught in the affected areas each round. Victims may make a DC 25 Reflex save for half damage. The lens orbits at a static height of 100 feet from the ground and moves at a speed of 20 feet per round.

"Deck of Many Things","strong (all schools)",20,"none",,0,"A deck of many things (both beneficial and malign) is usually found in a box or leather pouch. Each deck contains a number of cards or plaques made of ivory or vellum. Each is engraved with glyphs, characters, and sigils. As soon as one of these cards is drawn from the pack, its magic is bestowed upon the person who drew it, for better or worse. The character with a deck of many things who wishes to draw a card must announce how many cards she will draw before she begins. Cards must be drawn within 1 hour of each other, and a character can never draw from this deck any more cards than she has announced. If the character does not willingly draw her allotted number (or if she is somehow prevented from doing so), the cards flip out of the deck on their own. If the Idiot or Jester is drawn, the possessor of the deck may elect to draw additional cards. Each time a card is taken from the deck, it is replaced (making it possible to draw the same card twice) unless the draw is the Jester or the Fool, in which case the card is discarded from the pack. A deck of many things contains 22 cards. To simulate the magic cards, you may want to use tarot cards, as indicated in the second column of the accompanying table. If no tarot deck is available, substitute ordinary playing cards instead, as indicated in the third column. The effects of each card, summarized on the table, are fully described below. Balance: The character must change to a radically different alignment. If the character fails to act according to the new alignment, she gains a negative level. Comet: The character must single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or monsters encountered, or the benefit is lost. If successful, the character gains enough XP to attain the next experience level. Donjon: This card signifies imprisonment-either by the imprisonment spell or by some powerful being. All gear and spells are stripped from the victim in any case. Draw no more cards. Euryale: The medusa-like visage of this card brings a curse that only the Fates card or a deity can remove. The -1 penalty on all saving throws is otherwise permanent. The Fates: This card enables the character to avoid even an instantaneous occurrence if so desired, for the fabric of reality is unraveled and respun. Note that it does not enable something to happen. It can only stop something from happening or reverse a past occurrence. The reversal is only for the character who drew the card; other party members may have to endure the situation. Flames: Hot anger, jealousy, and envy are but a few of the possible motivational forces for the enmity. The enmity of the outsider can't be ended until one of the parties has been slain. Determine the outsider randomly, and assume that it attacks the character (or plagues her life in some way) within 1d20 days. Fool: The payment of XP and the redraw are mandatory. This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the Jester. Gem: This card indicates wealth. The jewelry is all gold set with gems, each piece worth 2,000 gp, and the gems are worth 1,000 gp each. Idiot: This card causes the drain of 1d4+1 points of Intelligence immediately. The additional draw is optional. Jester: This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the Fool. The redraws are optional. Key: The magic weapon granted must be one usable by the character. It suddenly appears out of nowhere in the character's hand. Knight: The fighter appears out of nowhere and serves loyally until death. He or she is of the same race (or kind) and gender as the character. This fighter can be taken as a cohort by a character with the Leadership feat. Moon: This card bears the image of a moonstone gem with the appropriate number of wishes shown as gleams therein; sometimes it depicts a moon with its phase indicating the number of wishes (full = four; gibbous = three; half = two; quarter = one). These wishes are the same as those granted by the 9th-level wizard spell and must be used within a number of minutes equal to the number received. Rogue: When this card is drawn, one of the character's NPC friends (preferably a cohort) is totally alienated and made forever hostile. If the character has no cohorts, the enmity of some powerful personage (or community, or religious order) can be substituted. The hatred is secret until the time is ripe for it to be revealed with devastating effect. Ruin: As implied by its name, when this card is drawn, all nonmagical possessions of the drawer are lost. Skull: A dread wraith appears. The character must fight it alone- if others help, they get dread wraiths to fight as well. If the character is slain, she is slain forever and cannot be revived, even with a wish or a miracle. Star: The 2 points are added to any ability the character chooses. They cannot be divided among two abilities. Sun: Roll for a medium wondrous item until a useful item is indicated. Talons: When this card is drawn, every magic item owned or possessed by the character is instantly and irrevocably lost, except for the deck. Throne: The character becomes a true leader in people's eyes. The castle gained appears in any open area she wishes (but the decision where to place it must be made within 1 hour). Vizier: This card empowers the character drawing it with the one-time ability to call upon a source of wisdom to solve any single problem or answer fully any question upon her request. The query or request must be made within 1 year. Whether the information gained can be successfully acted upon is another matter entirely. The Void: This black card spells instant disaster. The character's body continues to function, as though comatose, but her psyche is trapped in a prison somewhere-in an object on a far plane or planet, possibly in the possession of an outsider. A wish or a miracle does not bring the character back, instead merely revealing the plane of entrapment.

Its side is marked with the Sihedron Rune, while many other Thassilonian runes grace its rim. A runeslave cauldron has the ability to infuse the body of a freshly slain giant, reviving it and transforming it into a runeslave (see page 412). Before it can be used, the runeslave cauldron must first be activated by filling it with a specially prepared broth of rare necromantic ingredients and rainwater collected from several open graves. The cost of the special ingredients is 10,000 gp, but once the cauldron is filled, a fire lights under it automatically and keeps the broth bubbling and functional for 1 year. Once the cauldron is filled with broth, one need only sacrifice a giant (the method of killing the giant is incidental) and then place the giant's corpse wholly or partially within the cauldron's bubbling contents. One hour later, the sacrificed giant rises from the cauldron as if true resurrection had been cast on it. In addition, the newly revived giant gains the runeslave template (see page 412). The cauldron can revive up to five giants a day in this manner. Non-giant corpses placed in the broth are unaffected by the cauldron's magic. Any living creature (save for a runeslave) completely immersed in the boiling broth inside a functional runeslave cauldron immediately takes 6d6 points of fire damage per round. In addition, the smoke produced by the cauldron as it boils is particularly noxious to good-aligned beings. It spreads to a radius of 30 feet around the cauldron, and while the smoke isn't thick enough to obscure vision, its foul-smelling vapors sting and burn those of good alignment. Each round such a creature remains in the smoke, he must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be blinded and nauseated for as long as he remains in the area plus an additional 1d6 rounds after leaving the area.",,,"Artifact","RotRL-AE-Appendix",,,,,,,,,,"By brewing a certain variant mixture of broth and then attempting to use the runeslave cauldron to transform a good-aligned giant who volunteers for the job, the cauldron can be caused to crack open across the Sihedron carving.

"Runewell Of Greed","strong necromancy",20,"none",,"900 lbs.","Currently hidden at the heart of the Eye of Avarice in a demiplane lodged between Leng and the Material Plane, Karzoug's runewell of greed is the key to both his escape from the destruction of Thassilon and his eventual return to life. The runewell itself is a core part of the Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path, but by the time the PCs arrive at the Eye of Avarice, the circular well (which appears to be filled with molten gold) has already done its job absorbing fragments of greedy souls and is in the process of using that energy to finalize Karzoug's escape. Beyond this effect, though, Karzoug can utilize the runewell in other ways. It grants him the ability to use scrying at will, although the runewell's range is limited to the Xin-Shalast region or to specific agents like Mokmurian, Xanesha, and Lucrecia. Creatures that wear magic items marked with the Sihedron take a -4 penalty on saves against this effect. The runewell allows Karzoug to see through the eyes and speak through the mouths of anyone who wears a Sihedron medallion (see p age 426). H e can also, given time, call up from the runewell a live adult blue dragon minion to serve him as an ally or mount. This essentially functions as a gate spell, save that the dragon is actually created by the runewell rather than called. Karzoug can only have one such dragon in existence at any one time, and must wait 8 hours after a previous dragon's death before calling a new blue dragon to serve him. The runewell itself is 10 feet in diameter and 10 feet deep. The liquid it contains functions in all ways as molten gold-dealing damage is if it were lava upon creatures splashed or immersed within it. Gold drawn from the runewell cools normally and is permanent-the runewell immediately replenishes gold taken from its supplies-yet this gold cannot exist more than 30 feet from the runewell's rim. If brought beyond this range, it vanishes in an instant. Runewells associated with other runelords and sins exist throughout the ruins of Thassilon; each of these artifacts is a unique item with its own powers.",,,"Artifact","RotRL-AE-Appendix",,,,,,,,,,"The runewell of greed is linked to Karzoug, and as long as he lives, the runewell cannot be destroyed.

"Runewell, Minor","strong necromancy",20,"none",,"900 lbs.","Runelord Alaznist, inspired by and jealous of Karzoug's success with the runewell of greed, experimented with variant runewells of her own design. Many of these minor runewells of wrath existed in her domain-though today most are lost deep under the waters of the Varisian Gulf or are hidden away in Hollow Mountain, with only the one remaining on mainland Avistan hidden in the Catacombs of Wrath under Sandpoint. Every time a creature with a wrathful soul (including most goblins and quite a few of the victims murdered years ago by Jervas Stoot) dies within a mile of a minor runewell, it gains 1 wrath point. There's no limit to the number of wrath points the minor runewell can store, but it currently contains only 20. Each time the well's waters are drawn upon (as detailed below), a number of wrath points are expended. If enough points are expended to put its total at 0 or negative wrath points, the minor runewell deactivates, its waters fading away. Reactivating the minor runewell requires long-lost rituals-or the reactivation of a major runewell somewhere else in the world. Such an event restores a minor runewell of wrath to a starting level of 3 wrath points. A minor runewell is only 3 feet deep, yet any living creature that enters its freezing orange waters immediately takes 2d6 points of cold damage and must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or be overcome with wrath. Failure indicates the creature becomes enraged (as if under the effects of a rage spell) and immediately attacks the nearest living creature. If no living creatures are in sight, the enraged creature is compelled to seek out a victim, moving at full speed in its search. This rage persists for 2d6 minutes, after which point the creature becomes fatigued. Each activation of a minor runewell in this manner costs 3 wrath points. A minor runewell can also be commanded to disgorge a sinspawn. To manifest a sinspawn, a creature need only allow a few drops of its blood to fall into the pool. One round later, a sinspawn emerges from the well and immediately attacks the closest creature in which it cannot scent wrath.

By concentrating on a scrying device (such as a runewell), a runelord can sense the world through the Sihedron medallion wearer's senses, and could speak through her voice-provided the runelord knows of the existence of the medallion and the fact that it is being worn. Thus, Karzoug cannot use the medallion while it's worn by Nualia in Chapter One, as she is unknown to him, but once the PCs come to his attention later in the campaign, that may well change. See page 324 for more details on the ramifications of wearing a Sihedron medallion in Xin-Shalast. While worn, a Sihedron medallion grants its wearer a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws.

"Ioun Stone sepia ellipsoid","strong abjuration",18,"none","68,000 gp",0,"This dark stone sometimes appears to be made of transparent crystal filled nearly to the brim with dark ink. It provides the benefits of an iridescent spindle (sustains you without air), pearly white spindle (regenerate 1 hit point per 10 minutes), and an orange prism (+1 caster level). However, it has two drawbacks. First, once set loose to orbit your head, it dislikes being contained (including being placed in a wayfinder) and frees itself to orbit again 1d4+1 hours after being removed from its spinning path. Second, it drains the power out of other ioun stones, rendering them dull gray and powerless at a rate of one every 24 hours. Thus, it is an excellent and valuable item if you only have one ioun stone, but hard to conceal and dangerous to your other treasures. A remove curse or similar spell can put the stone at rest and prevent it from returning to its orbit. The Society has at least three specimens of this type locked in the Vaults to prevent ignorant Pathfinders from ruining perfectly good ioun stones. In theory you could place one directly into a wayfinder rather than ever letting it orbit, though conflicting reports suggest the sepia ellipsoid may be able to drain power out of orbiting stones even when contained in this way. The specimens in the Vaults are carefully locked in lead boxes to prevent them from draining the powers of other stored ioun stones.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, mage's disjunction, regenerate, water breathing, creator must be 12th level","34,000 gp.","Weapon","Seekers",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"NULL","NULL",0,0,,,"NULL",526

The brand enhances the share spells ability of druids, wizards, and other classes with animal companions or familiars, allowing these characters to cast spells with a range of personal or touch on the marked companion at a range of 30 feet, provided the character has line of effect to the creature. Each spell cast at range in this way drains one charge from the beast-bond brand for each spell level of the spell cast. A newly applied beast-bond brand has 10 charges. When all charges are consumed, the brand vanishes. For the purposes of teleportation spells and effects, the master may treat a marked companion as an object or a creature, whichever is more favorable (weight restrictions still apply). A character may have only one creature marked in this way at any time. The brand lasts until all charges are expended or the master marks another companion in this way.","Craft Wondrous Item, Reach Spell (Advanced Player's Guide), creator must have an animal companion or familiar","500 gp","Wondrous Item","Ultimate Equipment",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"faint",0,1000,500,,,"NULL",2173

When transformed, the club counts as a natural weapon and a manufactured weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured or natural weapons. The club also counts as the natural weapon of its current shape for the purpose of feats and spells that rely on specific natural weapons, such as Weapon Focus (bite) or the bloody claws spell (Advanced Player's Guide).

At night, the device focuses distant starlight, and the maximum damage is only 10d6, although the lens does not function at all for 1 hour before sunrise and 1 hour after sunset. The lens moves with a constant speed of 20 feet and damages everything caught in the affected areas each round. Victims may make a DC 25 Reflex save for half damage. The lens orbits at a static height of 100 feet from the ground and moves at a speed of 20 feet per round. It cannot be stopped or accelerated, although the path of the transit can be altered by a user in possession of the flame of guidance. When not directed, the lens maintains its last commanded path, eventually curving into a new elliptical orbit around its temple, scorching a path through whatever lies below. The user can alter both the damage (up to the maximum for the current lighting conditions) and the orbit in any direction, but the lens must move 20 feet each round, and cannot travel more than 3 miles from the temple in any direction before it curves back around and begins returning.

This grand and opulent castle is held aloft and propelled by a foundation of storm clouds constantly rumbling with thunder and crackling with electrical storms. Atop the massive storm cloud, the castle is shaped like a square, with 80-foot guard towers at each corner. At its center is a 140-foot tower with seven levels and more than 30 chambers. The central tower is well appointed with many halls, living chambers, suites, privies, kitchens (with pantries that magically replenish food stores every fortnight), and laboratories suitable for arcane and alchemical study. Each guard tower has living chambers and barracks for up to 25 guards, and one tower has an adjoining stable that can hold up to a dozen griffons, hippogriffs, pegasi, or even terrestrial mounts. In all, the tower can comfortably support a population of 300 Medium creatures. In order to fully take control of the castle, a creature must be at least 17th level, and must have the Leadership feat and 17 ranks in Knowledge (arcana). If the castle already has a master, that master must be defeated before another can take her place. The castle's movement is controlled by way of a control chamber located at the heart (a central chamber on its 4th floor). There, a font of pure elemental water serves as a scrying device for the castle's master, though it can view only places inside the castle or within 100 feet of it. The master (or a person she designates) can direct the castle's motion from within the chamber. It has a fly speed of 250 feet (clumsy) and uses the Fly skill modifier of the person controlling its motion; the castle can hover without needing to make a Fly check and never risks falling due to a failed check. When not being controlled, the castle moves randomly, sometimes changing direction every minute, sometimes holding the same course for days at a time, but always avoiding the ground or other hazards. It has the ability to travel to other planes, though no master other than the Storm King is known to have invoked this power. The master of the castle gains the following spell-like abilities. • Call lightning storm 1/day. The master must be in the control chamber or one of the towers to use this ability. • Guards and wards 1/day on the central tower. • Storm of vengeance 1/day. The master must be in the control chamber to use this ability, and the storm rains down from the castle's cloudy base upon everything within range underneath (2,200 feet). • Wind wall at will.

"Deck Of Many Things","strong (all schools)",20,"none",,0,"A deck of many things is usually found in a box or leather pouch. Each deck contains a number of cards or plaques made of ivory or vellum. Each is engraved with glyphs, characters, and sigils. As soon as one of these cards is drawn from the pack, its magic is bestowed upon the person who drew it, for better or worse. The character with a deck of many things who wishes to draw a card must announce how many cards she will draw before she begins. Cards must be drawn within 1 hour of each other, and a character can never draw from this deck any more cards than she has announced. If the character does not willingly draw her allotted number (or if she is somehow prevented from doing so), the cards flip out of the deck on their own. If the Idiot or Jester is drawn, the possessor of the deck may elect to draw additional cards. Each time a card is taken from the deck, it is replaced (making it possible to draw the same card twice) unless the draw is the Jester or the Fool, in which case the card is discarded from the pack. A deck of many things contains 22 cards. To simulate the magic cards, you may want to use tarot cards, as indicated in the second column of the accompanying table. If no tarot deck is available, substitute ordinary playing cards instead, as indicated in the third column. The effects of each card, summarized on the table, are clarified below. Balance: The character must change to a radically different alignment. If the character fails to act according to the new alignment, she gains a negative level. Comet: The character must single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or monsters encountered, or the benefit is lost. If successful, the character gains enough XP to attain the next experience level. Donjon: This card signifies imprisonment-either by the imprisonment spell or by some powerful being. All gear and spells are stripped from the victim in any case. Draw no more cards. Euryale: The medusa-like visage of this card brings a curse that only the Fates card or a deity can remove. The -1 penalty on all saving throws is otherwise permanent. The Fates: This card enables the character to avoid even an instantaneous occurrence if so desired, for the fabric of reality is unraveled and respun. Note that it does not enable something to happen. It can only stop something from happening or reverse a past occurrence. The reversal is only for the character who drew the card; other party members may have to endure the situation. Flames: Hot anger, jealousy, and envy are but a few of the possible motivational forces for the enmity. The enmity of the outsider can't be ended until one of the parties has been slain. Determine the outsider randomly, and assume that it attacks the character (or plagues her life in some way) within 1d20 days. Fool: The payment of XP and the redraw are mandatory. This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the Jester. Gem: This card indicates wealth. The jewelry is all gold set with gems, each piece worth 2,000 gp, and the gems are worth 1,000 gp each. Idiot: This card causes the drain of 1d4+1 points of Intelligence immediately. The additional draw is optional. Jester: This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the Fool. The redraws are optional. Key: The magic weapon granted must be one usable by the character. It suddenly appears out of nowhere in the character's hand. Knight: The fighter appears out of nowhere and serves loyally until death. He or she is of the same race (or kind) and gender as the character. This fighter can be taken as a cohort by a character with the Leadership feat. Moon: This card bears the image of a moonstone gem with the appropriate number of wishes shown as gleams therein; sometimes it depicts a moon with its phase indicating the number of wishes (full = four; gibbous = three; half = two; quarter = one). These wishes are the same as those granted by the 9th-level wizard spell and must be used within a number of minutes equal to the number received. Rogue: When this card is drawn, one of the character's NPC friends (preferably a cohort) is totally alienated and made forever hostile. If the character has no cohorts, the enmity of some powerful personage (or community, or religious order) can be substituted. The hatred is secret until the time is ripe for it to be revealed with devastating effect. Ruin: As implied by its name, when this card is drawn, all nonmagical possessions of the drawer are lost. Skull: A dread wraith appears. The character must fight it alone-if others help, dread wraiths appear to fight them as well. If the character is slain, she is slain forever and cannot be revived, even with a wish or a miracle. Star: The 2 points are added to any ability the character chooses. They cannot be divided among two abilities. Sun: Roll for a medium wondrous item until a useful item is indicated. Talons: When this card is drawn, every magic item owned or possessed by the character is instantly and irrevocably lost, except for the deck. Throne: The character becomes a true leader in people's eyes. The castle gained appears in any open area she wishes (but the decision where to place it must be made within 1 hour). Vizier: This card empowers the character drawing it with the one-time ability to call upon a source of wisdom to solve any single problem or answer fully any question upon her request. The query or request must be made within 1 year. Whether the information gained can be successfully acted upon is another matter entirely. The Void: This black card spells instant disaster. The character's body continues to function, as though comatose, but her psyche is trapped in a prison somewhere-in an object on a far plane or planet, possibly in the possession of an outsider. A wish or a miracle does not bring the character back, instead merely revealing the plane of entrapment. Draw no more cards. PLAQUE TAROT CARD PLAYING CARD SUMMARY OF EFFECT Balance XI.

When struck by bright light, the helm scintillates and sends forth reflective rays in all directions from its crown-like, gem-tipped spikes. The jewels' functions are as follows: • Diamond: Prismatic spray (save DC 20) • Ruby: Wall of fire • Fire opal: Fireball (10d6, Reflex DC 20 half) • Opal: Daylight The helm may be used once per round, but each gem can perform its spell-like power just once. Until all its jewels are depleted, a helm of brilliance also has the following magical properties when activated. It emanates a bluish light when undead are within 30 feet. This light causes 1d6 points of damage per round to all such creatures within that range. The wearer may command any weapon he wields to become a flaming weapon. This is in addition to whatever abilities the weapon may already have (unless the weapon already is a flaming weapon). The command takes 1 round to take effect. The helm provides fire resistance 30. This protection does not stack with similar protection from other sources. Once all its jewels have lost their magic, the helm loses its powers and the gems turn to worthless powder. Removing a jewel destroys it. If a creature wearing the helm is damaged by magical fire (after the fire protection is taken into account) and fails an additional DC 15 Will save, the remaining gems on the helm overload and detonate. Remaining diamonds become prismatic sprays that each randomly target a creature within range (possibly the wearer), rubies become straight-line walls of fire extending outward in a random direction from the helm wearer, and fire opals become fireballs centered on the helm wearer.

"Metamagician's Apprentice","strong divination",18,"none","93,605 gp","5 lbs.","This slender rod is usually capped with a metal knob resembling the face of a young male or female mage. The first rod of this type was created by a ruthless cabal of wizards and sorcerers who transferred the minds of their most promising apprentices into a set of rods for the sake of greater power. The bound apprentices' intellects have no free will but retain their rebellious imaginations. Under normal circumstances, the rod must do what its wielder commands, but it can make telepathic, respectful complaints about how unhappy it is to be a group of living minds imprisoned in an inanimate object-though few wielders care. While no good creature would create a metamagician's apprentice, he or she can still wield one. The rod can be used as a +1 light mace. On command, it transforms into a +1/+1 quarterstaff or back to its rod form. A metamagician's apprentice knows four metamagic feats (limited to feats that use a spell slot one or two levels higher than the spell's actual level, such as Silent Spell and Empower Spell) and acts as a greater metamagic rod for those feats. The rod can only apply one metamagic feat to a spell at a time, though (like a metamagic rod) the wielder can use his own feats and the rod's on the same spell. The rod can use read magic and detect magic at will. The metamagician's apprentice is never overwhelmed by powerful magic auras. These abilities do not trigger effects that require reading to activate (such as the explosive runes spell).

The migrus considers the last creature to release it from the locker is its master. The migrus moves in a strange jerky motion. It obeys simple verbal commands from its master. The migrus takes a very literal and brutal approach to problem solving and is fond of taking trophies. If the migrus is slain, it decays messily overnight in a glistening slick of putrid fluid. At the next dawn, the migrus reconstitutes within its locker (if the locker is opened before dawn, the partially-reconstituted migrus is visible inside, consuming the remnants of its former body. The migrus has attributes of a cat familiar (Bestiary 131) except it has the construct type. The migrus always does its best to return to its master and cannot be permanently destroyed by normal means.

"Mirror Of Life Trapping","strong abjuration",17,"none","200,000 gp","50 lbs.","This crystal device is usually about 4 feet square and framed in metal or wood. The frame typically depicts dragons, demons, devils, genies, coiling nagas, or other powerful creatures that are well known for their magical powers. It can be hung or placed on a surface and then activated by giving a command word. The same command word deactivates the mirror. A mirror of life trapping has 15 extradimensional compartments within it. Any creature coming within 30 feet of the device and looking at its own reflection must make a DC 23 Will save or be trapped within the mirror in one of the cells. A creature not aware of the nature of the device always sees its own reflection. The probability of a creature seeing its reflection, and thus needing to make the saving throw, drops to 50% if the creature is aware that the mirror traps life and seeks to avoid looking at it (treat as a gaze attack). When a creature is trapped, it is taken bodily into the mirror. Size is not a factor, but constructs and undead are not trapped, nor are inanimate objects and other nonliving matter. A victim's equipment (including clothing and anything being carried) remains behind. If the mirror's owner knows the right command word, he can call the reflection of any creature trapped within to its surface and engage his powerless prisoner in conversation. Another command word frees the trapped creature. Each pair of command words is specific to each prisoner. If the mirror's capacity is exceeded, one victim (determined randomly) is set free in order to accommodate the latest one. If the mirror is destroyed (hardness 1, 5 hit points), all victims currently trapped in it are freed.","Craft Wondrous Item, imprisonment","100,000 gp","Wondrous Item","Ultimate Equipment",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"strong",50,200000,100000,,,"NULL",2331

(It does not count as an item worn around the neck for the purpose of determining which of a character's worn magic items is effective.) If a character holds it, however, all can see the strand as it really is-a golden chain from which hang a number of golden spheres. The spheres are detachable by the wearer (and only by the wearer), who can easily hurl one of them up to 70 feet. When a sphere arrives at the end of its trajectory, it detonates as a fireball spell (Reflex DC 14 half). Spheres come in different strengths, ranging from those that deal 2d6 points of fire damage to those that deal 10d6. The price of a sphere is 150 gp for each die of damage it deals. Each necklace of fireballs contains a combination of spheres of various strengths. Some traditional combinations, designated types I through VII, are detailed above.

Each appears to be nothing more than a lesser magic ring until fully activated (by meeting a special condition, such as single-handedly slaying an elemental of the appropriate type or exposure to a sacred material of the appropriate element), but each has certain other powers as well as the following common properties. Elementals of the plane to which the ring is attuned can't attack the wearer, or even approach within 5 feet of her. If the wearer desires, she may forgo this protection and instead attempt to charm the elemental (as charm monster, Will DC 17 negates). If the charm attempt fails, however, absolute protection is lost and no further attempt at charming can be made. Creatures from the plane to which the ring is attuned that attack the wearer take a -1 penalty on their attack rolls. The ring wearer makes applicable saving throws against the extraplanar creature's attacks with a +2 resistance bonus. She gains a +4 morale bonus on all attack rolls against such creatures. Any weapons he uses bypasses the damage reduction of such creatures, regardless of any qualities the weapon may or may not have. The wearer of the ring is able to converse with creatures from the plane to which her ring is attuned. These creatures recognize that she wears the ring, and show a healthy respect for the wearer if their alignments are similar. If alignments are opposed, creatures fear the wearer if she is strong. If she is weak, they hate and desire to slay her. The possessor of a ring of elemental command takes a saving throw penalty as follows. ELEMENT SAVING THROW PENALTY Air -2 against earth-based effects Earth -2 against air- or electricity-based effects Fire -2 against water- or cold-based effects Water -2 against fire-based effects In addition to the powers described above, each specific ring gives its wearer the following abilities according to its kind.

These glowing globes resemble dancing lights, and the wearer controls them similarly (see the dancing lights spell description). The spheres have a 120-foot range and a duration of 4 rounds. They can be moved at 120 feet per round. Each sphere is about 3 feet in diameter, and any creature who comes within 5 feet of one causes its charge to dissipate, taking electricity damage in the process according to the number of balls created. NUMBER OF BALLS DAMAGE PER BALL 1 lightning ball 2d6 points of electricity damage 2 lightning balls 3d6 points of electricity damage 3 lightning balls 2d6 points of electricity damage 4 lightning balls 1d6 points of electricity damage Once the ball lightning function is activated, the balls can be released at any time before the sun rises. Multiple balls can be released in the same round. The second special function produces three shooting stars that can be released from the ring each week, simultaneously or one at a time. Upon impact, they deal 12 points of damage and spread (as a fireball) in a 5-foot-radius sphere that deals 24 points of fire damage. Any creature struck by a shooting star takes full damage from the impact plus full fire damage from the spread unless it succeeds at a DC 13 Reflex save. Creatures not struck but within the spread ignore the impact damage and take only half damage from the fire spread on a successful DC 13 Reflex save. The range is 70 feet, at the end of which the shooting star explodes unless it strikes a creature or object before that. A shooting star always follows a straight line, and any creature in its path must make a successful DC 13 Reflex save or be hit by the projectile. Indoors at night, or underground, the ring of shooting stars has the following properties. • Faerie fire (once per day) • Spark shower (special, once per day) The spark shower is a flying cloud of sizzling purple sparks that fan out from the ring for a distance of 20 feet in an arch 10 feet wide. Creatures within this area take 2d8 points of damage each if not wearing metal armor or carrying metal weapons. Any creature wearing metal armor and/or carrying a metal weapon takes 4d8 points of damage.","Forge Ring, faerie fire, fireball, light, lightning bolt","25,000 gp","Ring","Ultimate Equipment",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"strong",0,50000,25000,,,"NULL",1443

She can instantly detect a spell's level as the rod absorbs that spell's energy. Absorption requires no action on the part of the user if the rod is in hand at the time.

The wielder of the rod can use captured spell energy to cast any spell she has prepared without expending the prepared spell itself. The only restrictions are that the levels of spell energy stored in the rod must be equal to or greater than the level of the spell the wielder wants to cast, that any material components required for the spell be present, and that the rod be in the wielder's hand when he casts the spell. For casters such as bards or sorcerers who do not prepare spells, the rod's energy can be used to cast any spell of the appropriate level or levels that they know. A rod of absorption can absorb a maximum of 50 spell levels and thereafter can only discharge any remaining potential it might have. The rod cannot be recharged.

A soulbound eye must be attached to a willing or helpless creature by pressing the spike-covered surface to the creature's brow-the gem swiftly and painfully embeds itself in the victim's forehead, immediately activating to forge a shared link between the wearer and the creature who placed the item on its head (the ""master""). Once implanted, the soulbound eye allows the master to observe the world around the wearer through the wearer's senses. It also allows for telepathic communication between the wearer and the master. Neither of these features function across planar boundaries. The soulbound eye's wearer is not compelled to obey its master's telepathic commands, but the master can use the soulbound eye as a conduit for hold monster, modify memory, pain strike (Advanced Player's Guide), and suggestion spells, treating the wearer as the target of the spell no matter the distance between master and wearer. The victim is allowed any normal saving throws or spell resistance against spells cast through the soulbound eye.

It can be caused to move, however, by mental effort (think of this as a mundane form of telekinesis, too weak to move actual objects but a force to which the sphere, being weightless, is sensitive). A character's ability to gain control of a sphere of annihilation (or to keep controlling one) is based on the result of a control check against DC 30 (a move action). A control check is 1d20 + character level + character Intelligence modifier. If the check succeeds, the character can move the sphere (perhaps to bring it into contact with an enemy) as a free action. Control of a sphere can be established from as far away as 40 feet (the character need not approach too closely). Once control is established, it must be maintained by continuing to make control checks (all DC 30) each round. For as long as a character maintains control (does not fail a check) in subsequent rounds, he can control the sphere from a distance of 40 feet + 10 feet per character level.

If this is willingly lowered, however, the staff can also be used to absorb arcane spell energy directed at its wielder, as a rod of absorption does. Unlike the rod, this staff converts spell levels into charges rather than retaining them as spell energy usable by a spellcaster. If the staff absorbs enough spell levels to exceed its limit of 50 charges, it explodes as if a retributive strike had been performed (see below).

"Word Bottle","moderate evocation",7,"none","1,500 gp","1 lb.","This fragile glass flask encloses a single scrap of worn parchment held in place by a taut metal wire threaded through its cork stopper. As a full-round action, a spellcaster can cast a targeted language-dependant spell of 3rd level or lower into the flask as a full round action, which covers the parchment with magical writing and charges the flask with power. The flask cannot be used with spells that have a casting time longer than 1 full round. Any of the spell's variables that are determined by its caster (such as commands given to the spell's target) are decided when the spell is cast into the bottle. The charged flask can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. The flask shatters and is destroyed upon impact, releasing the stored spell. A creature struck by the flask is subject to the effects of spell contained within, just as if it had been the target of the spell. Creatures within 5 feet of the flask when it breaks hear whispery echoes of the spell's words and are also subject to its effects, though they receive a +5 bonus on their saves to resist the spell. If the spell does not ordinarily allow a save, creatures caught in the splash radius may still make a Will save to negate it (with the +5 bonus).","Craft Wondrous Item, imbue with spell ability","750 gp","Wondrous Item","Ultimate Equipment",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"moderate",1,1500,750,,,"NULL",2422

The distance traveled with earth glide does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 5-foot increments.

"Torc of Kostchtchie","overwhelming conjuration",25,"neck",,"2 lbs.","This collar of finely wrought gold is inscribed with all manner of vile runes. It contains a piece of the demon lord Kostchtchie's mortal soul, entrapped by the witch Baba Yaga. The torc grants its wearer immunity to cold and the ability to command frost giants at will. This ability functions as dominate person, but affects only frost giants, who take a -10 penalty on their saves. In addition, the wearer can cast giant form II three times per day. Anyone who wears the torc for 1 week also gains the ability to summon an aspect of Kostchtchie once per day. This aspect takes the form of an Abyss gigas (see Appendix 2) who faithfully serves the wearer of the torc for 1 hour. Using the torc in this way certainly alerts Kostchtchie to the torc's whereabouts, and the demon lord will not rest until he has recovered the torc. In addition, any time one of the torc's powers is used, there is a cumulative 5% chance the wearer goes berserk (gaining all the benefits and drawbacks of the barbarian's rage ability), attacking the nearest non-giant creature until unconscious or dead or until no living non-giant remains within 30 feet.",,,"Artifact","Witch War",,,,,,,,,,"As Baba Yaga was the one who created the torc, only she possesses the means of destroying it.
